## Notes

To run this program it is necessary to have a composite manager like ![picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) or xcompmgr running to make the window transparent, if you are using a desktop like Gnome or KDE you are probably already using it, but if you are using a window manager like i3, you have to run it before you start using pincel.
